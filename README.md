# This is a CRUD Web Application that has a developed filtering system

For the Full Stack Application, Angular was used to develop this Frontend while ExpressJS was used for the Backend.\
Odoo's System and Features was a large inspiration in the creation of this system.

Repository of the ExpressJS Backend for this application: https://github.com/Swasbuckler/filter-search-crud-server\
It will detail the features, database and packages used, which includes details of the PostgreSQL Database and Express Server.

The demo of this Frontend can be accessed here: <i>Work in Progress</i>

Repository of the Alternatively made React Frontend for this application: <i>Work in Progress</i>

I will return to working on this project at a later date, as I wish to focus my attention to other interested projects.

## What have I Achieved and Learnt through this Project

Through the development cycle of this project I have learnt a lot of key concepts related to Angular, ExpressJS and PostgreSQL.\
For Angular specifically, I have gained a greater understand of it's Component Lifecycle, Directives and Pipes, which throughout the Development Process helped guide me to simplify the creation of certain Application Features. I hope to carry over this knowledge to future projects.

One of the major challenges I had faced in development was handling Project Scope and Requirements.\
Initially this Application was envisioned to be part of a larger Full Stack Application as I wanted to create an Inventory management Application. However due to the Project Timeframe I had given myself and the large number of Bugs encountered which expectedly lead to Delays. Thanks to this I had Restructured this project 3 times, cutting down the Project Scope and Requirements each time.\
With this experience, I now know how to better plan for future projects with a set Timeline even if the Project was a Personal Project that does not have strict guidelines.

In the end, I was able to develop a full stack application that was able to meet my satisfaction and final requirements.
